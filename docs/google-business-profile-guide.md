Follow these steps to establish a strong local SEO presence for Ekanostudio.

## 1. Create/Claim Your Profile
1.  Go to [Google Business Profile Manager](https://www.google.com/business/).
2.  Click **Manage Now** and sign in with your business Google account.
3.  Enter your business name: **Ekanostudio**.
4.  Select your business type: **Service business** (since you visit customers or deliver online) and/or **Storefront** (if you have a physical office open to clients). *Given your address "Red Square Market, Mehta Nagar", it likely qualifies as a physical location.*

## 2. Basic Information

-   **Address**: Enter your exact address: "Red Square Market, Mehta Nagar, Hisar, Haryana 125001".
-   **Service Areas**: Add "Hisar", "Haryana", "India", "USA", "UK" (if you target global clients, though GBP prioritizes local).
-   **Phone**: Use a dedicated business number.
-   **Website**: `https://www.ekanostudio.com`

## 3. Verification
-   Google will likely mail a postcard with a code to your physical address. This takes 1-2 weeks.
-   Once received, enter the code in the GBP dashboard to verify.

## 4. Optimization Checklist
-   **Description**: Use the optimized description from our SEO audit: "Ekanostudio is a premier Digital Transformation Agency in Hisar, providing expert Web Design, SEO, AI Automation, and Performance Marketing services..."
